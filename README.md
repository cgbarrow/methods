# methods
A simplified fork of the [18F Methods](https://github.com/18F/methods) site. Some HTML/CSS and a little sprinkle of JavaScript. 

The .NET Solutions Delivery Centre / Human Centred Design (HCD) Methods and tools describe how HCD puts human-centred design into our engagements. While this resource is designed to be maintained as an internal tool, we encourage organizations in both the public and private sector to adopt human centred designed into their products and services.
