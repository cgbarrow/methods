                        <h1>What</h1>
                        <p>A visual mechanism (tool) to record and keep track of all of the collateral produced from the Discovery
                            phase.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Why</h1>
                        <p>The discovery phase is an intensive 3-6 week process. Copicous amounts of information and data can
                            be produced in a short period of time. Very often, the collateral ends up being stored disjointly
                            on an array of media including local hard drives, file shares, restricted on-prem document management
                            systems, and cloud based services.</p>
                        <p>When the need arises to compile and present the work produced and the journey (how we got there),
                            there is a large amount of time wasted in first locating and then aggregrating this information.</p>
                        <p>A discovery blog will help the balanced team keep all of the collateral produced stored, centralized,
                            and ordered in a single place that can be accessed by everyone, anywhere on any device.</p>

                                <li>Create a guide for yourself of some topics you’d like to ask about, and some specific questions
                                    as a back up. Questions will often concern the individual's role, the organization, the
                                    individuals’ needs, and metrics for success of the project.</li>
                                <li>Sit down one-on-one with the participant, or two-on-one with a note-taker or joint interviewer,
                                    in a focused environment. Introduce yourself. Explain the premise for the interview as
                                    far as you can without biasing their responses.</li>
                                <li>Follow the conversation where the stakeholder takes it. They will focus on their priorities
                                    and interests. Be comfortable with silences, which allow the stakeholder to elaborate.
                                    To keep from getting entirely off course, use your interview guide to make sure you cover
                                    what you need to. Ask lots of "why is that" and "how do you do that" questions.</li>

                        <p>After finishing this 3-hour sprint, the balanced team gets a common and concrete representation of
                            your organization's brand. When you're faced with a big decision - about naming, identity, marketing,

                            <p>You need two to six participants for a Brand Sprint. These have to be organizational executives,
                                decision-maker or major stakeholder. Your Brand Sprint needs to include people with authority
                                and ownership of your company’s identity.</p>
                            <p>You must have in the room:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>CEO or equivalent (DM, ADM, CIO)</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>And at least one of these:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Head of marketing or equivalent</li>
                                <li>Head of product design (product owner)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>One participant must be the "Decider" — the company’s true decision-maker about your brand. This
                                does not work without the Decider. Find some way to fit the Brand Sprint into their schedule.
                                If they won’t make the time, don’t do the sprint.</p>

                            <h1>Set the Ground Rules</h1>
                            <p>Once everybody’s together in the room, the Brand Sprint has two simple rules to maintain focus:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>No devices. Put away your laptops, phones, etc.</li>

                        <p>A facilitated exercise in which participants list their individual priorities onto cards, collect
                            them as a group, organize them by relationship, and establish group priorities through individual
                            voting.

                        <p>To reach a consensus on priorities of subjective, qualitative data with a group of people. This is
                            especially helpful with larger groups of stakeholders and groups with high risk of disagreement.</p>

                                            feedback within reasonable time.</li>
                                        <li> The system should speak the user’s language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar
                                            to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.</li>

                                <li>Gather research from earlier activities like
                                    <a href="#stakeholder-and-user-interviews">stakeholder interviews</a> in a way that’s easy to review. You can create placeholder
                                    personas without research to teach user-centered thinking, but because they’re effectively
                                    stereotypes, avoid using them for implementable design decisions.</li>
                                <li>Create a set of user archetypes based on how you believe people will use your solution. These
                                    typically get titles (for example, "data administrators" rather than "those who submit
                                    data").
                                </li>
                                <li>Analyze your records for patterns as they relate to user archetypes. Specifically note frequently
                                    observed goals, motivations, behaviors, and pain points.</li>
                                <li>Pair recurring goals, behaviors, and pain points with archetypes. Give each archetype a name
                                    and a fictional account of their day. Add a photo of someone who fits the description,
                                    but ideally not an image of someone you’ve actually interviewed and who may be recognized.</li>
                                <li>Link your personas to the research that inspired them. This is useful when researchers are
                                    interested in challenging the way a persona stereotypes a user.</li>

                            Through creating user scenarios, you'll identify what the user's motivations are for coming to
                            your site as well as their expectations and goals. User scenarios also help the team answer questions
                            about what the product should do as well as how it should look and behave.</p>

                            analysis is documented in a diagram that traces a user's possible paths through sequences of

                                <li>Based on user research, identify target users' goals that need to be analyzed.</li>
                                <li>For each goal, identify common scenarios and the tasks and decisions that the user or system
                                    will perform in each scenario. Don't assume you and your stakeholders share the same
                                    understanding of the tasks. The idea is to make the flow of tasks explicit in the diagram,
                                    so that you can check your understanding by walking through the diagram with users (steps
                                    4 &amp; 5).</li>
                                <li>Produce a diagram that includes each task and decision point that a user might encounter
                                    on their way toward their goal. While there are several diagrammatic languages that can
                                    be used to produce task flow diagrams, the basic look is a flow chart of boxes for tasks
                                    and decision points and arrows showing directionality and dependencies among tasks. The
                                    diagram should cover the common scenarios identified in step 2. </li>
                                <li>Present the diagram to a subject matter expert who knows the task(s) well enough to check
                                    for accuracy.</li>
                                <li>In collaboration with users and/or subject matter exprts, annotate the task flow diagram
                                    to pinpoint areas of interest, risk, or potential frustration.</li>

                        <p>
                            Framing your work as a hypothesis means no longer just thinking about the thing you’re making or building, but paying more
                            attention to whether that work is achieving your intended goals and outcomes. This in turn means
                            thinking about your work as a series of experiments you do with your users to learn if you’re
                            on the right path. Instead of asking "Did we ship the shopping cart feature?" you ask: "Did we
                            make it easier and simpler for our customers to buy from us?"
                        </p>
                        <h1>Why</h1>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>When done collaboratively, hypothesis-building is powerful at getting a team on the same page about
                            what it’s doing and why. It also allows the team to be flexible — if one approach doesn’t result
                            in the outcome you expected, you have implicit permission to change course and try something
                            else.

                                        you’re trying to solve. You may want to write broad hypotheses at the outset of a

                        <p>To identify content that needs to be revised in new versions of a website. Content audits can also
                            help you identify who is responsible for content, how often it should be updated, and what role
                            a particular piece of content plays for users.</p>

                            also gives designers a great opportunity to start asking developers early questions about feasibility

                                <li>Stage a scenario in which someone who would actually use your product tries to complete a

                                    example, to test a new layout for a "user account" section on a voter registration website,
                                    recruit only people who already register to vote online.)</li>
                                <li>Analyze the user's attempt to complete the task, looking especially for areas where they
                                    struggled or questions they asked to inform design changes.</li>

                                to a standard:</p>

                                    <strong>Automated Assessment</strong>: Automated assessment involves the use of software designed
                                    to assess website accessibility. This type of assessment is sometimes referred to as
                                    a rules-based, algorithmic or heuristic assessment. For example, an automated assessment
                                    is used to identify instances where alternative text is not provided for an image.</li>

                                    plug-ins. This type of assessment is sometimes referred to as an expert assessment. The
                                    purpose of this assessment is to apply more judgment to an assessment to catch qualitative
                                    issues and identify issues that might be missed by an assistive technology user.</li>

                                    <strong>Conduct Assistive Technology based assessment</strong>: this assessment approach involves

                        <p>Despite the fact there is so much attention on the strategic value of innovation, very few organizations know how to make it a reliable and repeatable practice. 
                            If innovation is so important, why aren't more organizations better at it?

                            <h1>Assumptions and Reality</h1>
                            <p>To begin with, there are four major assumptions organizations make that prevent them from achieving
                                    systemic innovation.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Assumption</strong>: Innovation as it is currently practiced is good enough.
                                    <br/><br/><strong>Reality</strong>: Current innovation practices don't reliably deliver breakthroughs. 
                                         There is a lack of a set of reliable tools and methods for creating real breakthroughs 
                                         rather than incremental or random improvements.<br/><br/></li>
                                <li><strong>Assumption</strong>: Innovation is for executives
                                    <br/><br/><strong>Reality</strong>: Practitioners "on the ground" are most often the source of breakthough ideas 
                                        but they need structures and processes to help them plan and define innovation.<br/><br/></li>
                                <li><strong>Assumption</strong>: Innovation is just for practitioners
                                    <br/><br/><strong>Reality</strong>: Innovation isn't just for practitioners. Practitioners need to work with executives 
                                          to be able to integrate innovation tactics into a larger strategy.<br/><br/></li>
                                <li><strong>Assumption</strong>: "Innovation Planning" is an oxymoron.
                                    <br/><br/><strong>Reality</strong>: Measured, scientific approaches to innovation do exist, and can make it a systematic process.</li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Build innovations around experiences</strong>: Experience can be defined as the "act of living through events". Although
                                    the term "user experience" (or UX) has become associated with the software and information technology industries,
                                    user experience is a key factor in the success of any type of offering.<br/><br/> Every company and organization in some measure
                                    creates or affects peoples' experiences. Focusing on the nature of those experiences provides the perfect starting
                                    point for innovation.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Think of innovations as systems</strong>: An offering, whether it is a product, a service, or media/message, belongs
                                    to a larger system of offerings, organizations, and markets. A "system" can be defined as any set of interacting
                                    or interdependent entities that form an integrated whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/> Innovators who
                                    understand how this larger system works can better create and deliver offerings with high value.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Cultivate an innovation centre</strong>: This principle is about cultivating a mindset among people in an organization
                                    that everyone is activiely engaged in innovation on a daily basis and that everyone's actions can add up to the overal
                                    cultural behaviour of the organization. An innovation practice is a collaborative process and people with competencies
                                    in different fields need to come together to make the process thorough, inclusive, and valuable.<br/><br/> Engineers, technical
                                    experts, managers, designers, business planners, marketing researchers, financial planners, end-users, and potentially
                                    community members, all need to come together in a shared mental space. Athough this level of collaboration is a huge
                                    challenge, organizations can take small steps that eventually can lead to big positive changes in the innovation
                                    culture of organizations.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Adopt a disciplined innovation process</strong>: Once again, "innovation planning" is not an oxymoron. Successful
                                    innovation can and should be planned and managed like any other organizational function. It is possible to create
                                    innovations using well-developed processes and repeatable methods, all in the service of supporting and extending
                                    the other three principles of successful innovation - understanding experiences, thinking in terms of systems, and
                                    fostering an innovation culture. <br/><br/>A high degree of discipline is necessary for these processes and methods to work,
                                    but when they do, the probability of creating successful innovations can increase dramatically. Simply recognizing
                                    and understanding that innovation can and should be planned is the first, critical step.</li>

                        <p>Incentives often result in a more diverse, representative set of participants. Without incentives,
                            you often end up recruiting people with a strong intrinsic interest in your website. These people
                            may not have the same needs and experiences as a less interested pool of users. With incentives,
                            you can encourage less interested, more representative people to participate.</p>

                                    with your organization's authorities. The options will depend upon your agency's authorities
                                    and the specific facts.</li>
                                <li>Consider contracting for a recruiting service to help you get an effective research pool.</li>
                                <li>If incentives are determined to be permissible, clearly communicate when and how participants
                                    will receive incentives. In the emails, postings or other materials you use to recruit
                                    your participants, describe the incentive and how participants will receive it (via mail,
                                    pick up at an office, etc.). This is particularly important for "remote" research.</li>

                            who aren’t your core users while using the right methods.</p>

                        <p>The product owner is typically a product's key stakeholder. Part of the product owner responsibilities
                            is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the balanced
                            team. This is key to successfully starting any deveopment on a product or service.</p>

                                priority must address the Product Owner.</p>
                            <p>The product owner is commonly a lead user of the system or someone from marketing, product management
                                or anyone with a solid understanding of users, the market place, the competition and of future
                                trends for the domain or type of system being developed. </p>
                            <p>For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions.
                                The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog.
                                No one can force the Balacnced Team to work from a different set of features or functions.</p>
                            <p>The product owner must be 100% committed and available throughout the product's lifecycle.</p>

                            The product manager makes feature decisions: writing stories and prioritizing what to build next. Together with the balanced
                            team, the product manager participates in design activities, builds, maintains, and prioritizes
                            the backlog.

                            value for their company and users. They facilitate decision-making in service of shipping successful
                            features. You’ll need to clearly understand who your users are and what they need, what impact
                            the business expects from the product and who your stakeholders are. You’ll also need to collaborate
                            closely with your team.</p>

                                <li>Articulate the Product Vision and Product Strategy - So that the balanced team knows why
                                    they are undertaking the effort of building the product, and what the plan for doing
                                    so is.</li>
                                <li>Prioritize Features - So that the balanced team is always working on the most valuable thing.</li>
                                <li>Manage the Backlog - So that the balanced team has a shared focus across tactical design
                                    and development work.</li>

                                    they are on the right path or not.</li>
                                <li>Decide When to Ship Software - So that customers can experience the benefits of the product
                                    as soon as possible, and the balanced team can continue to gather valuable feedback about
                                    how to iterate on the product.</li>
                                <li>Continually De-Risk Product Direction - So that the balanced team only builds the features
                                    they should build, based on validated customer problems and business opportunities, and
                                    increase the likelihood that the product will be successful in the market</li>
                                <li>Help the Team Maintain Sustainable Pace - So that the balanced team can go fast forever and

                            Engineers implement stories from the backlog. They also assist with story estimation in the Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM).
                            Engineers guide the implementation and help the balanced team understand the technical implications
                            of product decisions. Together with the product manager, engineers will work to validate your
                            backlog’s prioritization and help the balanced team gain understanding of what product success
                            looks like.

                        <p>
                            Product engineers ensure that the balanced team makes sound technical decisions, that engineering practices are healthy and
                            appropriate, and that engineering team collaborates well with Product Manager (PM) and designers.
                            Engineers also ensure that the balanced team collectively owns the codebase and understands the
                            engineering decisions that are made.</p>

                            <p>Product Engineers undertake these responsibilities:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Taking responsibility for the quality of the software produced. Instead of turning over some
                                    code to a separate and independent group for testing, the balanced team, as a whole,
                                    takes responsibility for the quality of the work they produce. An engineer may or may
                                    not do the testing himself/herself but the key point is that the quality of the code
                                    is not someone else’s responsibility.</li>

                                <li>Interacting as necessary to clarify product features and requirements. Engineers will typically
                                    not be given a complete set of technical or functional requirements. More often, the
                                    engineer will get some defined user stories that are intended to be a "placeholder for
                                    conversation". The engineer will be expected to interact with the Product Owner (PM),
                                    designers and end-users as necessary to better define what is needed.</li>

                                <li>Taking responsibility for estimating, planning, and managing all of his/her own tasks and
                                    reporting on progress. </li>

                                <li>Collaborating closely with members of the balanced team to take shared responsibility for
                                    the overall efforts that the balanced team has committed to. </li>

                            While discovery is about research, alpha is about testing hypotheses and experimentation. The purpose of alpha is to determine
                            how to meet the user needs that were identified in discovery. It’s an opportunity to quickly
                            test many different approaches with users before building a service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alpha is fast-paced and may go in many unexpected directions before defining what the final solution could look like. Try
                            new approaches to solving problems and test them quickly, so that potential issues can be found
                            and fixed before investing too much time and money into one design.

                        <p>
                            Beta is when the service finally comes to life. The goal of beta is to build a real service that works well for a larger
                            group of people. The prototypes that were developed and tested during alpha are used to build
                            a minimum viable product in a live, user-facing environment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Build quickly and in small segments, taking the time to confirm that each segment of the service is on the right track. Launching
                            a public service is the ultimate usability test, as it collects real data and user feedback.
                            Feedback is used to refine the service, adding and adjusting features until the service is complete.

                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                            Live begins when the service has officially launched. While most people understand the purpose of live, it’s not always given
                            the attention and resources it deserves.</p>
                        <p>
                            Without proper resources devoted to live, services become quickly outdated and fail to meet both the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-service-standard" target="_blank">Digital Service Standard</a>
                            and user needs.</p>
                        <p>
                            Continuous improvement is one of the core principles of product and service design and that’s what live is all about. The goal is to
                            continuously monitor, research, test and iterate for as long as the product or service is active.</p>
